# Private Sphere Gatsby Theme

It is possible to use Gatsby [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-api/#shadowing) to override the styles, content, and components of this theme; however, you will need to provide your own data. Data for the social widgets must be available via URL. Examples of the expected response structure can be found in [/theme/**mocks**](/theme/__mocks__).
