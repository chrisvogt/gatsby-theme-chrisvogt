    I'm a Sr. Software Engineer on a product team at GoDaddy, working on intelligent customer dashboards, in-app navigation, and reusable components. Outside of work, I live in the Castro 🏳️‍🌈 in San Francisco, and I enjoy photography, practicing piano and traveling to new places.

    This website is a digital garden where I share things I'm excited about, things I've learned and things I'm working on.
