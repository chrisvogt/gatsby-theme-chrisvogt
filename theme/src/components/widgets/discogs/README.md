## Configuration

Add to your site metadata in `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    widgets: {
      discogs: {
        widgetDataSource: 'https://metrics.chrisvogt.me/api/widgets/discogs'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## API Data Structure

The widget expects data from the `/api/widgets/discogs` endpoint with this structure:

    "LPs Owned": 37
  },
  "profile": {
    "profileURL": "https://www.discogs.com/user/username/collection"
