        This is my personal blog and digital garden: a place where I share what Iâ€™m building, exploring, and learning
        over time.

      <Themed.p>
        By day, I work as a software engineer at GoDaddy, creating tools that help small businesses build, grow, and
        understand their online presence. But this site isnâ€™t about work â€” itâ€™s where I follow my curiosity, experiment
        with ideas, and write code just for fun.

      <Themed.p>
        Most evenings, youâ€™ll find me at the piano â€” practicing, recording, or just playing around with sound. Iâ€™ve been
        slowly teaching myself music, and Iâ€™m figuring out how to bring what I know from tech into making music. I also
        spend a lot of time with friends in the city and love connecting with people who are passionate about what they
        do.
      </Themed.p>

      <Themed.p>
        This space is always evolving â€” part notebook, part playground â€” and Iâ€™m glad you found your way here.
