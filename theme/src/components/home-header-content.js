      Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris Vogt.

    <Themed.p>
      I'm a Sr. Software Engineer on a product team at GoDaddy, working on intelligent customer dashboards, in-app navigation,
      and reusable components. Outside of work, I live in the Castro in San Francisco, and I enjoy photography, practicing piano
      and traveling to new places.

    <Themed.p>
      This website is a digital garden where I share things I'm excited about, things I've learned and things I'm working on.
