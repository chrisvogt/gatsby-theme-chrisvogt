Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I want to share a new piano cover that I recorded a few months ago: "Ebb Tide." This is an instrumental version of a classic song made popular by The Righteous Brothers in the 1960s.

## About "Ebb Tide"

"Ebb Tide" is a song Iâ€™ve played since I was a child. My grandfather, Buddy Milton, was a professional pianist from the 1940s through the 1990s. He passed away when I was very young, but my mom always told me how she would ask him to play "Ebb Tide" because he had a way of making it sound like ocean waves rolling in and out. Although Iâ€™ve never found a recording of him playing it, Iâ€™ve always loved the song and have tried to recreate that feeling with runs up and down the chords.

## The Recording

This recording was done in one take, aiming to capture the essence of the song in the moment. Itâ€™s probably the most authentic-sounding recording Iâ€™ve been able to achieve from a digital piano.

Thanks for taking the time to listen!
