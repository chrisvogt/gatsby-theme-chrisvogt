Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a quick piano practice session with you. On November 11, 2022, I spent some time practicing "Cold Little Heart" by Michael Kiwanuka on a new piano with hammer action keys. If you're interested, here's the audio recording:

ðŸŽ§ Listen to the audio recording: [Link to SoundCloud Audio](https://soundcloud.com/c1v0/cold-little-heart-kiwanuka-piano-cover)

**Simple and Unedited:** No frills, no fancy editingâ€”just me and the piano. The song, written by Brian Burton, Dean Cover, and Michael Samuel Kiwanuka, is in the key of Bâ™­ major.

I've grown to love the acoustic sound of the studio recording for "Cold Little Heart." I became obsessed with a 10-minute ballad version I found on Spotify. According to the app Last.FM, which I've used to track songs I've listened to since 2008, I've spent a significant amount of time immersed in this song. I've listened to "Cold Little Heart" a combined total of approximately 3 hours and 14 minutes.

In this session, I'm trying something newâ€”I'm using a keyboard with hammer action keys instead of the usual weighted keys I'm used to. Hammer action keys replicate the feel and mechanism of acoustic piano hammers, providing a more authentic piano playing experience. Weighted keys, on the other hand, offer resistance to simulate piano key weight, but lack the hammer mechanism simulation. Both enhance the piano playing feel on digital keyboards. This change in keys brings a different touch and vibe to the music, and I'm excited to share this variation with you.

Feel free to listen, and if you have any thoughts or feedback, I'd love to hear from you. Enjoy the music!
