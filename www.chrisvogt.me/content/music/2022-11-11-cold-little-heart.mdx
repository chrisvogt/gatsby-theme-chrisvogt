I've been listening to the song Cold Little Heart by Michael Kiwanuka a lot lately, specifically [this 10-minute version](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qprlw0jfsW4H9cG0FFE0Z?si=3a81bd14efe74447) with an improvisational piece at the beginning and have started practicing it on the piano. This is my version of Cold Little Heart.
