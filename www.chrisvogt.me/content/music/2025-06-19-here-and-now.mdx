Ten years ago today, I uploaded a piano cover of _Here and Now_ by Luther Vandross that I recorded in one of the practice rooms at Phoenix College. It's been just about 10 years since that was uploaded and it's now my most watched video on YouTube. So I'm sharing it here on my website.

I'll rerecord this soon since my style and sound has evolved over time, which will be interesting to compare.
