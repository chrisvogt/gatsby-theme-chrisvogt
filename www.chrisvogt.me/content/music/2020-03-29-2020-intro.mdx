It's been 5 years since I last recorded and shared a song. 10 years ago that would be unthinkable. For many years, my hobby was recording electronic synthesizer music in a band practice room I rented in Tempe, Arizona near ASU. I'm now refamiliarizing myself with tools used to make music. This song – 2020 Intro – is the result of that, made with 13 original tracks and one drum sample in Ableton Live.

I'm going to make an effort to regularly create and iterate on recordings, and plan to revisit this song soon. I hope to start a whole series of blog posts with music I create and things learned while doing that. A long time ago I used the artist name "Find Me By Midnight" to publish that music online and I plan to resume using that and to revive [my SoundCloud account](https://soundcloud.com/findmebymidnight).
