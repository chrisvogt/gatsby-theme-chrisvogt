Hi everyone,

I recently spent a weekend afternoon practicing "A House is Not A Home" by Burt Bacharach and Hal David on my piano at home. It's a beautiful and emotional piece that I've always enjoyed playing.

ðŸŽ§ Listen to the audio recording: [Link to SoundCloud Audio](https://soundcloud.com/c1v0/cold-little-heart-kiwanuka-piano-cover)

Playing this piece always brings a sense of peace and reflection. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Feel free to leave your thoughts and feedback in the comments.

Happy listening! ðŸŽ¹
