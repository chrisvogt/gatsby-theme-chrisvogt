This year I was in New York City for Stonewall 50 â€“ WorldPride NYC 2019, which recognized the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall Riots and was the first WorldPride event held in the United States.

Following are some of my favorite shots from exploring Manhattan, attending NYC Pride 2019, the Queer Liberation March and the Dyke March.
