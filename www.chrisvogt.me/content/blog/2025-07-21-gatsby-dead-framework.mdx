# Am I Building on Top of a Dead Framework?

Since 2019, I’ve been steadily evolving my personal website, [chrisvogt.me](https://www.chrisvogt.me), into a digital home that reflects both who I am and the things I love. Along the way, I’ve written custom components, built reusable layouts, refined the design to match my personality—and now I’ve started converting it all into a theme others can use for their own blogs and digital gardens.

That theme is built with GatsbyJS. And lately, I’ve been asking myself: is that a mistake?

## Why I Chose Gatsby in the First Place

When I started building this version of my site in 2019, I chose Gatsby for a few reasons. I was already using Next.js at work—my company had committed to going all-in on it—and I wanted to stretch myself by learning a different but adjacent framework on my own time. Gatsby’s ecosystem intrigued me, especially its emphasis on performance, GraphQL-based data sourcing, and static site generation. It seemed like the perfect place to experiment and grow my front-end skills with a modern stack.

Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate Gatsby’s plugin model, its strong developer experience, and how easy it is to generate a fast, SEO-friendly site out of the box. But as time’s gone on, the framework’s future has started to feel... uncertain.

## The Acquisition That Changed Everything

A couple of years ago, GatsbyJS was acquired by Netlify. And shortly after that, the entire core team left.

Since then, the pace of development has slowed dramatically. Netlify has publicly stated they’ve deprioritized Gatsby feature releases, and that they’ll only be maintaining it with occasional security patches. Even they acknowledge that only around 20% of their user base is still relying on Gatsby. That’s a polite way of saying: it’s not where the future is headed.

Search for “Is GatsbyJS dead?” and you’ll find dozens of blog posts echoing the same conclusion. The community has largely moved on. New contributors are scarce. And the roadmap—if there is one—feels more like a history book than a guide to where things are going.

## So Why Am I Still Building With It?

The irony is... I’ve created something I really like. My website works well, and I’ve been able to build it exactly how I envisioned using Gatsby. That experience has given me the confidence to extract it into a theme that I can share with others—open source, free to use, and tailored for digital creators like me.

But I keep circling back to the same question: why invest more time into a framework that might already be dead?

Making my work reusable is something I care about. But is it a wasted effort if no one wants to start a new Gatsby project today? Or worse—if no one can?

## Where This Leaves Me

For now, I’m going to keep building. I still enjoy using Gatsby, and as long as it helps me create the site I want, I see value in finishing the theme and making it available. But I’m also treating this work with a bit more caution.

I’m designing the theme with portability in mind. If it needs to be migrated to another framework in the future—Next.js, Astro, Remix—I want that to be possible. What I don’t want is to spend months building ever-deeper integrations with a stack that’s no longer growing, no longer maintained, and no longer attracting new developers.

## Your Thoughts?

So here’s my open question: **If you were in my shoes, what would you do?**

Have you built something you loved on top of a tool or platform that stopped being supported? Have you migrated away from Gatsby—or stuck with it against the odds? Should I keep building this theme out as a way to share what I’ve made, or pause and port it somewhere more future-friendly?

This isn’t a farewell letter to Gatsby. But it is me asking: is this a Sisyphean task, or just a stepping stone?

Let me know what you think.
