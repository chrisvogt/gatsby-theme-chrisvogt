A few years ago, I put together a simple visualization comparing public school teacher pay across all 50 U.S. states. I originally made it to satisfy my own curiosity. My mom taught English as a Second Language (ESL) when I was growing up, and she moved from California to Arizona when I was a teenager. I figured others might find it useful too—so I published it at [teachersalary.info](https://teachersalary.info).

It’s a pretty basic project: a single-page React app that pulls in data and renders an interactive chart. But recently, I discovered that the site’s been quietly helping over **1,000 unique visitors each month** explore how teacher compensation compares across the country.

So I’ve decided to put some effort back into the project—to modernize and expand it with more visualizations. I’m just getting started!
