I am a software engineer in San Francisco who is enthusiastic about books, cameras, code,
dogs, and music. In 2016 I moved to San Francisco where I live with 3 roommates and a goofy golden retriever mix who makes
frequent appearances on [my Instagram feed](https://instagram.com/c1v0/).

This website is a [personal project on GitHub](https://github.com/personal-site/blog) that has gone through [many iterations](https://web.archive.org/web/*/chrisvogt.me) since its inception in 2012. My goal is to develop this site â€“ beyond just the blog â€“ into a central source for all of my public social content.

In the upcoming posts I'll use my website to share things I find interesting, collections of drone and camera shots I capture, and insights gained while building this website and the services that provide it data. If any of that interests you, follow this blog for new posts.
