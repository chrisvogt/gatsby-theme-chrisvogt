Hi there! In September 2022, I embarked on an 8-day cruise with my family on Royal Caribbean's Quantum of the Seas. We sailed from Seattle to Alaska and then to the charming city of Victoria, Canada before returning home.

This gallery showcases photos and video I took during our trip, in narrative form.

## Day 1: Departure from Seattle, Washington

Our adventure began in Seattle, where we set sail at 4:00 PM. The excitement was palpable as we left the port, with the iconic Space Needle and the beautiful Seattle skyline bidding us farewell.

I recorded this short clip of us sailing to Alaska. The ship, the sky, and the scenery was stunning.

## Day 2: Cruising the Open Sea

The second day was spent at sea traveling up the Pacific Northwest coast. At one point I found some of my group playing tabletop games up top near the pool. This video shows what I stumbled onto.

## Day 3: Ketchikan, Alaska

We arrived at Ketchikan where I grabbed a few shots of the Quantum of the Seas from the outside.

We took the "Ketchikan Waterfront and Wildlife Cruise" tour in Ketchikan, but didn't see much that day. The rest of the day I spent exploring the town and taking photos.

Creek Street, a historic area in Ketchikan, deserves its own section. This vibrant locale is bustling with tourists and lined with charming gift shops. Known for its colorful totem poles, Creek Street offers a unique glimpse into the cultural heritage and lively atmosphere of Ketchikan.

## Day 4: Sitka, Alaska

Our next stop was Sitka, where we explored the town's rich history, beautiful landscapes, and vibrant wildlife. The first thing I noticed stepping off the ship were large crabs on display. They were huge! Check this out.

Next we walked into the city to have a look around. This is what Sitka looks like.

I became captivated by a particular scene and decided to experiment with depth of field. I took a series of five photographs, progressively adjusting the focus to capture the boat coming into sharper view. Hereâ€™s the sequence and how it turned out.

Next, my family and I set out to hike the Totem Trail, a 1.0-mile loop trail that winds through the Sitka National Historical Park. The trail features totem poles, lush forests, and scenic views of the Sitka Sound. Here are a few totems we saw along the trail.

While my dad and stepmom were walking away on the trail, I took this photo of them. It's one of my favorites from the trip because they love to explore on their own and my dad dresses in vibrant colors, and I feel these capture all of that well.

Luckily, we didn't see any bears.

Before we left, most people were exhausted from hiking, and I got some goofy photos and series photos of the group. Here are my travel companions.

## Day 5: Juneau, Alaska

Juneau, the state capital, offered us a blend of urban charm and natural beauty. Here are a few shots I took when we pulled up to the city.

We visited the Mendenhall Glacier, which provided a fascinating look at glacial formation and the effects of climate change, took a tram ride up Mount Roberts, and tasted some of the freshest seafood at local eateries.

## Day 6: Cruising the Open Sea

Another day at sea allowed us to relax and enjoy the ship's amenities. We attended various onboard activities, dined at the specialty restaurants, and took in the beautiful ocean views. For a brief moment there was a double rainbow outside the ship.

## Day 7: Victoria, Canada

We arrived in Victoria, a city known for its British charm and beautiful gardens. Highlights included visiting the Butchart Gardens, exploring the historic downtown, and admiring the architectural splendor of the Fairmont Empress Hotel and the Parliament Building.

## Day 8: Return to Seattle

Our journey concluded as we sailed back to Seattle. On our last day we took family photos together on the ship.

After disembarking, I opted to go directly to the airport, and what I found was intense. The airport was packed.

## Final Thoughts

This cruise was more than just a vacation; it was a chance to reconnect with family. My brother lives in a suburb of Seattle, I live in San Francisco, my dad was living in Palm Springs at the time, and my mom and other brother are in Phoenix. It was a chance for us to all be together in one place and enjoy each other's company.

And, finally, for two things that did _not_ actually happen. ðŸ¤£
