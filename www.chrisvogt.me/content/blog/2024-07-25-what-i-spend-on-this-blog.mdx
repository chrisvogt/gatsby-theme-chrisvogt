## Service Breakdown

- **Firebase & Google Cloud (Backend Services):** These services provide the backend infrastructure, including databases, authentication, and serverless functions. The bulk of the cost comes from Cloud Scheduler jobs at $0.09. Other minor costs include Cloud Storage at $0.02 and Cloud Functions CPU time at $0.01.

- **Netlify (Website Hosting, SSL & DNS):** Netlify is used for hosting the website, providing secure connections via SSL, and managing DNS. I am using 1.5GB of bandwidth per month.

- **Imgix (Image CDN):** Imgix is used for optimizing and delivering images. I have 37 origin images hosted.

- **Cloudinary (Image CDN):** Cloudinary handles image storage, optimization, and transformations. My usage includes 228MB of storage, 5.3GB of bandwidth, and 210 transformations.

- **Google Workspace (Email):** This service provides professional email accounts. The current cost for this service is $7.20 per month.

- **Uptime Robot (Website Monitoring):** Uptime Robot monitors the website's uptime and provides notifications in case of downtime. The free tier is sufficient for my needs.

- **SquareSpace (Domain Registration):** SquareSpace manages the domain registration. The cost is $20 per year, which translates to approximately $1.67 per month.

- **Codecov (Code Coverage Reporting):** Codecov provides code coverage reporting to ensure code is well-tested. The free tier is sufficient for my needs.

## A Comment on Redundancy

I know I can consolidate services and am using multiple providers for similar services. This website is a personal project where I feel safe experimenting with new tools and tech. In time, I'll migrate and consolidate service providers to my favorites.

I built my entire site by hand, which allows me to keep costs very low. The infrastructure includes a full API behind the GatsbyJS front end, all included within the minimal monthly expenses. It's incredible how affordable it can be to maintain a professional and fully functional personal website these days, thanks to various free tiers and efficient resource management.

Thanks for reading!
