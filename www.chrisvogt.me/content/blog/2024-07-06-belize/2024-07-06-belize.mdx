In July 2023, I spent the first week exploring Belize with my partner on his family's "let's travel somewhere outside of the country" vacation. During my trip, I swam with sharks, stingrays, and even a manatee; savored Belizean, Caribbean, and Texan cuisine; and drove around in golf carts to discover the enchanting "Secret Beach." This photo gallery captures my visits to Ambergris
Caye, Caye Caulker, and the Belize Barrier Reef, highlighting the natural beauty and unique experiences of each location.

## Where is Belize?

<p style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  Imagine the turquoise waters and white sandy beaches of the Caribbean, then picture a tropical paradise nestled between Mexico and Guatemala on the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula. Thatâ€™s Belize! Itâ€™s a small, English-speaking country in Central America with lush jungles, ancient Mayan ruins, and the second-largest coral reef in the world, just a short flight away from the southern United States.

## Getting to Belize from San Francisco

Direct flights from San Francisco to Belize are rare. You usually connect through major hubs like Dallas, Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, or Atlanta. I did a layover in Houston, and my flight to Belize was full of vacationers and Texans heading to vacation homes or on tropical adventures.

To reach Ambergris Caye, you need another connection in Belize City, flying with Maya Island Air or Tropic Air. I flew in a small Cessna 182 Skylane, a single-engine, four-seat light aircraft, piloted by a multitasking pilot who also served as the flight attendant. Despite the well-used planes, the short flight offered stunning views of the Caribbean Sea and the Belize Barrier Reef.

## Driving around Ambergris Caye

Once on Ambergris Caye, golf carts became my primary mode of transportation. These small, versatile vehicles are the island's main way of getting around due to its limited road infrastructure. My group rented a few golf carts for the week, which were essential for traveling in and out of San Pedro. Driving a golf cart is quite an experience, with speed limits around 5-15 miles per hour and the need to navigate the island's narrow streets and bustling town center. They come with steering wheel locks or "clubs" so you can lock your golf cart when you're not using it. ðŸ˜…

## Where I stayed

My group stayed at the Pelican Reef Villas, a charming resort situated on the southern end of Ambergris Caye, about 2.5 miles south of San Pedro. The villas are small condos that wrap around a pool with a swim-up bar and a patio restaurant. Our villa had a full kitchen, which I used a few times to prepare breakfast with ingredients from the local market. It had a full-size refridgerator and oven, a kitchen bar and dining table, living rooms and private balconies with views of the pool and the Caribbean Sea.

Behind Pelican Reef Villas, at the shore, there's a dock for swimming, snorkeling, and embarking on excursions to the reef. The water taxi can also shuttle you over to San Pedro from there. The dock is fantastic spot for watching the sunrise or sunset, with two inviting hammocks that are perfect for lounging. One day, someone from our group fell asleep in one for hours and woke up with a sunburn that resembled a lobster.

## Exploring San Pedro and tasting local cuisine

San Pedro is the main town on Ambergris Caye, where we went to eat, shop, and explore the local culture. Getting there is a 15-minute ride on a golf cart or a 45-minute to one-hour walk. I did the walk once, and it felt like walking through a scene in Jurassic Park. Along the way, you pass a section of the San Pedro Lagoon with warning signs about crocodiles. While I saw the signs, I didn't spot any crocodiles. ðŸ˜…

Once you get into the city, you'll find a mix of local shops, restaurants, and bars, along with a few grocery stores and a bakery. We visited several local restaurants, each offering a unique experience:

* **Caramba Restaurant:** Here, you can pick your fish from a display outside, and they cook the exact fish you selected. It's a fun and interactive dining experience.
* **Charmaine's Cafe and Dessert Shop:** A great spot for a casual meal and delicious desserts.
* **The Islands Jungle Restaurant & Bar:** This place features a neat "jungle" theme, complete with a skilled guitarist playing live music, making for a memorable dining experience in a lush, green setting.
* **Island Wonder Beach Club:** Perfect for a beachside meal with stunning views.
* **Someplace South Cafebar:** A large restaurant and bar with a patio and small stage. Run by Texans who moved to Belize, it's a great spot for live music and dancing.
* **Happyâ€™s Tequilaria:** A small dive bar and restaurant run by Texan expats. A great place to enjoy a variety of tequilas and unwind after a day of exploring.

San Pedro offers a vibrant and diverse dining scene, making it a highlight of our trip to Ambergris Caye.

## A short day trip to Secret Beach

A few times throughout the week we heard about "Secret Beach", a popular spot on the western side of Ambergris Caye. To get there, you need to drive through the island's interior, which is a bumpy, dusty, and sometimes muddy journey. The road is lined with small homes, local shops, and a few resorts, offering a glimpse into the island's local life.

One day, a group of 3 of us â€“ me, my partner and his cousin â€“ took one of the golf carts to go find this "Secret Beach". It turned out to be a very pretty spot, with bars and restaurants lining the beachfront.

## Exploring Caye Caulker

On Friday, towards the end of the trip, I took a water taxi to Caye Caulker, a smaller island southeast of Ambergris Caye. The water taxi ride took about 45 minutes and I spent a few hours exploring the island before catching the last taxi back.

The next time I go to Belize, I plan to stay at Caye Caulker for a few days. It had a very relaxed, Caribbean beach vibe and there were a lot of interesting restaurants, bars and shops to explore. More than I was able to check out in just a few hours.

The food in Caye Caulker was so good that it needs its own section. If you like seafood, definitely try the lobster. ðŸ¤¤

## Snorkeling with sharks, stingrays, and manatees

I didn't get any photos snorkeling because I forgot my GoPro battery charger at home and there was no place on the island to buy those. And it's not the first time I've made that mistake. ðŸ˜… But I did catch a few shots with my phone during the boat ride.

I went with a group on a snorkeling tour to the Belize Barrier Reef and Shark Ray Alley. There the tour guides fed sharks and stingrays to gather them around the boat. It was a bit scary at first, but overall a fun experience. The sharks ignore and swim right past you. Our boat crew searched around for a manatee, saying they heard of recent sightings earlier that day, and we found one and jumped in and briefly swam next to it until it left. It looked like a sea dog!

## Also, iguanas

I saw at least two iguanas on the island. One was hanging out on the dock at Pelican Reef Villas, and the other was sunbathing on a rock at Secret Beach. They're pretty chill and don't seem to mind people walking by.

## Going home

At the end of my trip I boarded small plane back to Belize City and reversed my flight path home. This one was a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, a bit larger than the Cessna I arrived in.
