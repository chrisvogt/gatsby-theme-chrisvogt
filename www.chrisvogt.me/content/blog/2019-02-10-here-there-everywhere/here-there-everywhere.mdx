  Me practicing "Here, There and Everywhere" on the piano. This is the first in a

Me playing a jazz rendition of "Here, There and Everywhere", recorded on a Nikon dSLR and an iPhone. Using YouTube, I figured out how to create and edit a multi-camara sequence in Premiere Pro. The resulting video is very amateur, but I'm happy with it for a first attempt at recording these. :)
