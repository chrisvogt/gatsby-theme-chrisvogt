In July 2024, I embarked on a journey aboard Virgin Voyages' Valiant Lady. I did their 5-night Mayan Sol sailing from Miami to Costa Maya, MX, and Bimini, Bahamas. This blog post captures the highlights of my trip, from a dramatic start with a plane fire to vibrant experiences in Costa Maya and Bimini.

## Being Evacuated from the Plane at SFO

My trip began with an unexpected event. During boarding, our flight, AA 2045, was evacuated due to a passenger's laptop bag catching fire near the back of the plane.

An announcement came over the speakers: "There's a fire in the back of the plane." People around me looked confused since there was no smoke or sign of what was happening from the front. Suddenly, a rush of people began pushing from the back to get out through the front. We were still docked at the terminal, so I ran out, while those in the back used the emergency slide.

A replacement airplane didn't arrive until 11:15 PM, turning the flight into a red-eye. Luckily, I had planned to be in Miami 2 days before the cruise, so I made it in time.

## A Day in South Beach, Miami

The day before the cruise, I met up with another friend who was joining us on the cruise, and we spent the day walking around South Beach and trying out a restaurant called CVI.CHE 105 that was _so_ good. ðŸ¤¤

## Setting Sail on the Valiant Lady

The day had finally arrived to board the Valiant Lady and set sail on the Mayan Sol itinerary. I decorated my room's door with refrigerator magnets to make it feel like home.

The views as we set sail were amazing. Every time I visit Miami, new buildings seem to pop up.

Throughout the week, I received frequent alerts suggesting my laptop was lost at sea. ðŸ¤£

## Exploring Costa Maya and Mahahual, Mexico

The next day, we docked at Costa Maya. The cruise ships dock at a port that is a short walk to the town of Mahahual. The port has a large pool, a swim-up bar, and a shopping area.

After stepping off the ship, I took these photos showing the outside of the ship and Nick standing in front of it.

The weather was warm and humid, with a brief, warm rain shower that lasted 10 minutes. I hung out in this area for a while browsing shops and waiting for a friend to finish breakfast.

In Mahahual, we encountered fascinating wildlife, including monkeys and flamingos.

Nick is obsessed with finding spider monkeys and squirrel monkeys, and he found one in Mahahual.

We also saw flamingos, macaws, and many Carib Grackles. The flamingos at the port walk right up to the tourists.

### Departing Costa Maya

During our departure, we visited our friend Eric's cabin, which faced the Harmony of the Seas. It was massive, and as it pulled away, people waved at us, and we waved back.

## Scarlet Night on Valiant Lady

That night was Scarlet Night on Valiant Lady. I wore a white lace shirt and red glitter pants, both from Knobs in the Castro. Virgin includes the pool deck in the party, encouraging everyone to dance in the shallow end of the pool. It was a blast!

## Bimini, Bahamas and the Beach Club at Bimini

Our final stop was Bimini, where we enjoyed the pristine beaches and the exclusive Beach Club.

Most passengers I spoke with recommended spending the day at the Beach Club and not booking excursions, but I did book an excursion, and I'm glad I did. One of the highlights of my trip was this stingray excursion. We were boated out to a private island surrounded by stingrays.

## Reflections

Traveling with Virgin Voyages was a new and interesting experience. Before this, I had only sailed with Celebrity and Royal Caribbean, and Virgin does things differently.

For one, the absence of kids was a big selling point. Everything is designed for adults and has a modern, party vibe. The ship has an onboard drag queen they call a "diva" who hosted events like drag bingo with high-dollar prizes (someone won over $1,000).

The food was great. Well, Test Kitchen was a bit odd, but the other restaurants were fantastic. I did miss the buffet. Virgin has a food hall instead of a buffet, and the food quality there wasn't the best, but it was consistent.

## Conclusion

My 2024 Caribbean cruise with Virgin Voyages was filled with adventure, relaxation, and unforgettable moments. I highly recommend this cruise for anyone looking for a mix of luxury and exploration.
