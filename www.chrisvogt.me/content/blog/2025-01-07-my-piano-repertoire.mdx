For years, I kept track of the songs I wanted to learn and practice on piano in a simple text file. In March 2020, I decided to better organize my repertoire by moving the list to a Google Sheet. This made it easier to track my progress and share updates with friends who were interested in hearing me play or record my performances.

Fast forward to 2025, and Iâ€™ve taken the next step: publishing the list online to make it even more accessible. I built a straightforward Next.js single-page app to display the songs, along with notes on my performance quality and transpositions needed to play them in their original keys. The app also includes links to sheet music for each piece.
