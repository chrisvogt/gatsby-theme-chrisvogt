For a long time, I kept a running list of songs I wanted to learn on piano in a plain text file. Nothing fancy—just a quick way to jot things down as they came to me. Then in early 2020, I moved everything into a Google Sheet so I could track my progress a bit more thoughtfully. It also made it easier to share with friends who were curious about what I was working on or wanted to hear a recording.

Now in 2025, I’ve taken it a step further and put the whole thing online. I built a simple single-page app with Next.js that displays my full repertoire, including notes about how well I feel I can play each piece and whether I had to transpose it to get it closer to the original key. I also included links to sheet music when available, in case you're looking to try any of the songs yourself.
